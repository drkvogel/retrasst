Hi Chris

 

My notes from today’s meeting:

 

Part 1

-          Chunk list should show destination boxes rather than source

-          Columns (left to right): cryovial barcode, site, vessel position, vessel name, shelf (if necessary), structure name, slot, current box, current position, destination box, destination position

-          Usual sort order before chunking: destination box and position

-          Usual sort order for each chunk: vessel position, shelf, structure, slot and current position

-          Only display primary aliquots.  Show aliquot type(s) but not as a separate column

-          Don’t allow people to save a plan with chunks of more than 1001 samples for sample retrieval/disposal/reorganisation

 

Part 2

-          Chunk list should include a second row for each chunk if there is a secondary aliquot

-          Only read the currently selected chunk/aliquot from the database when it is selected

-          Columns (left to right): cryovial barcode, site, vessel position, vessel name, shelf (if necessary), structure name, slot, current box, current position, destination box, destination position

-          Allow user to fill gaps in boxes from secondary aliquot after primary aliquot (partly?) completed

 

Empty source boxes (all cryovials “accepted” or “not found”) will normally be discarded.  Final stage should ask user to confirm that vessel/structure/slot is now empty, otherwise box should be referred.  All source boxes from a reorganisation task should end up empty
