## combineAliquots()

does combineAliquots work properly?

can we use it in collect?

in collect, the old method is used, relying on alternating order of primary/secondary. seems to do a reasonable job. code should be shared for consistency, though.



###  978243 "Retrieval_978243", "Reveal boxes of three types"

Contains secondaries, but not as backups (not same destination position) of primaries

### 978243 ("Reveal boxes of three types")

Primaries with secondaries (?) as backups

## seconday aliquot label greyed out

why is seconday aliquot label greyed out in collect? ie. 

    labelSecondary->Enabled = false;







## confusing methods?

currentSample(), 
currentAliquot()
chunk->currentObject()
fillRow()


## chunkComplete()

## SaveProgressThread::Execute()

## SaveProgressThread::storeSample()

## SaveProgressThread::jobFinished()
