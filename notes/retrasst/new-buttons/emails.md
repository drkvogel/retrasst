## emails about retrieval assistant, buttons, and tables

Hi Martin
 
I hope this now reflects this morning's discussion 
 
There will be seven buttons: Enter, Not Found, Skip, Bad, Note, Save and Sign Off. 

Hi Martin 
 
We continued the discussion after you left and hope we've come up with something that fits the requirements. It has roughly six buttons: Enter, Not Found, Skip, Bad, Note and Sign Off. 
 
Working through my four scenarios (ignoring the complication of secondaries): 
 
1) Look in the box, find the right sample, scan it in or type the barcode and hit Enter: 
 If that entry is Expected, it would be marked as Collected; 
 If Deferred, it would be marked as Found Later (the distinction may be of little relevance to the user). 
 
2) Look in the box, find the wrong sample, scan it in or type the barcode and hit Enter: 
 The user is asked to check the sample. If they confirm the barcode: 
  if the entry is Expected, it would be marked as Deferred; 
  if already Deferred, it would be marked as Not Found. 
 
3) Look in the box and find nothing there. Hit Not Found: 
 If that entry is Expected, it would be marked as Deferred; 
 If it's already Deferred, it would be marked as Not Found (maybe with an "are you sure?" dialogue). 
 
4) Decide not to look (e.g. for a secondary). Hit Skip: 
 Entry remains Expected or Deferred (but allows user to move to the next one). 
 
The Bad and Note buttons add a flag and/or note to the expected sample when you scan the barcode (or modify the one you've just dealt with? We couldn't be sure; they can't do both). 
 
The Sign Off button is disabled until they reach the end of a chunk. It is not enabled if any entries are still Expected. It gives a strong warning if any entries are still Deferred; if the user decides to ignore the warning, Deferred entries will be marked Not Found, or it may be simpler not to enable Sign Off until everything is marked as Collected, Found Later or Not Found. 
 
I hope that makes sense. Your comments would be welcome

## after 6-hour mega meeting, Fri 2014-07-25

Hi Martin 
 
The discussion following your departure was long, detailed and not always harmonious but I think we're a lot closer to coming up with a suggestion that gives you most of what you want without too many major changes. I still have a few nagging questions, though. 
 
There are various ideas floating about: 
 
1) An exercise: one or more retrievals. It has a name and description but very little else. The other day we agreed that each retrieval must belong to an exercise. 
 
2) A retrieval. Each retrieval has a number. If samples are being retrieved into new boxes, the barcode will usually include the retrieval number as a prefix, creating a box set. At present we also record a name, description and reason for each retrieval. Question: do we need all three or do some relate to the exercise? 
 
3) A retrieval list: the samples to put into the boxes and where you ought to be able to find them. It might suggest more than one sample for a given position, in case you can't find their first choice. 
 
4) A retrieval plan: created from a retrieval list by the Retrieval Assistant. Whereas the list is often in destination box/position order (e.g. for analysis), the plan dictates the order in which the samples must be collected (for ease of retrieval). A plan may by divided up into chunks. 
 
5) A retrieval task: working through a retrieval plan to collect the samples, guided by the Retrieval Assistant. 
 
6) Retrieval stages, e.g. List created, plan created, samples being retrieved, task complete, sent to RDB, shipped... This has a new table in the database and a new screen in StoreMan. 
 
Until today I assumed you created a list, created a plan from it, retrieved the samples, signed it off and that was it. The current system therefore assumes a 1:1 relationship between list, plan and task; plans cannot be modified once they've been created so, currently, nor can a retrieval list. Question: if we can't come up with a suitable solution, is this a limitation you can live with? As a work around for missing cryovials you'd have to create a new retrieval list to work with an existing box set, giving your two retrievals with the same retrieval number. 
 
If you do need to edit (in some sense) a retrieval list, it would make our lives a lot easier if you couldn't modify an existing plan. KEY QUESTION: can you add to a list that's being acted on or vice versa? Thinking about the spreadsheet model, Martin sets it up, Tim might create the plan and Richard may act on it but can Martin edit it before Richard and Tim have finished with it. I'd like to hope not. In which case we can still create tasks from plans and plans from lists but what you can do is governed by the stage you are at. 
 
I'll put together a draft table design on Monday. I don't know if we'll have a chance to discuss it next week if Thursday's the only day we're all in but Chris has also had some ideas about the user interface

Hi Nick 


I think I detected two questions in there:

Question: do we need all three or do some relate to the exercise?

There does appear to be some duplication but I don't think we ever got round to formalising how we'd use these fields so I'm not sure we want to change these too much until we've agreed how these fields should be used and what each represents.

KEY QUESTION: can you add to a list that's being acted on or vice versa?

In your discussion you suggest that an in progress retrieval might be edited once started. I think it's fairly safe to say this is highly unlikely. It's best to think of a retrieval as fairly static, replacement samples would only be required if the project suggests suitable replacement samples once it has been confirmed that a tube in the original list is missing, ordinarily this would be done once the first attempt at retrieval had been made for all samples in that retrieval.

Hope that makes sense and doesn't complicate things.

Martin

That establishes the ground rules.  Iâ€™ll send you alternative suggestions for the database design in case you want to comment on Thursday

Hi Martin 
 
I've put something in your diary for 11am. The meeting room is booked so it's back to the Tulip Tree. Hopefully we can keep the discussion short this time

Hi Martin 
 
I have fixed the problem you had on Friday and updated the version of StoreMan on the K: drive. 
 
(Chris: there are also changes to the project file in CVS, including a new version number, and updates to the xlib code) 
-- 
Nick

Hello both 
 
In the light of Friday's discussions, we might need further changes to the database structure to allow users to "edit" a retrieval list. This shouldn't result in big changes to anyone's code since it is "highly unlikely" to mean anything more adding samples to the end of the list to fill in any gaps after the initial retrieval has been completed. 
 
Three options for your consideration: 
 
1) Allow multiple records in `c_retrieval_job` for the same box set 
 
When the user wants to edit an existing retrieval, Create List copies relevant fields into a new record, leaving box_set unchanged but creating a new `retrieval_cid`. In effect, `c_retrieval_job` becomes a list of attempts (tasks). The `c_retrieval_history` table will need to be modified slightly to link to the box set, rather than the attempt. 
 
`Start_date` and `finish_date` probably become obsolete (use `c_retrieval_history` instead). I think `external_name` does too, leaving description, reason, `project_cid` and `primary_aliquot` for each attempt. 
 
2) Link each retrieval plan to a stage in the retrieval history 
 
In this version, editing a retrieval list would add new `cryovial_store` records with the existing `retrieval_cid`, but only after the earlier records had been dealt with. The retrieval assistant would see it as a new retrieval and create a new plan. The `c_retrieval_history` table would link on `c_retrieval_job`, as now, but `c_box_retrieval` would link to the relevant record in `c_retrieval_history`, keeping the plans separate. Only the most recent would be active. 
 
`Start_date` and `finish_date` would definitely become obsolete. Others could move to `c_retrieval_history` or even `c_retrieval_note`. As Martin points out, we need to agree how each of these fields are used. This may help us decide between (1) and (2) 
 
3) Create a new table: `c_retrieval_task`
 
Create list would create one or more records in `c_retrieval_task`, linking to `c_retrieval_job`. Each task would include a priority. `Cryovial_store` (and box_store) would link to `c_retrieval_task`, as would the plans in `c_box_retrieval`. Editing an existing list would simply mean adding another task with a lower priority. The Retrieval Assistant would then create another plan. 
 
The key difference between this proposal and (2) is that it allows overlapping tasks. Perhaps, with hindsight, this is the most flexible design of the three. The confusion about aliquot types goes away: you'd just have two tasks, one for the primaries, one for the secondaries. You'd probably have different tasks for different projects, too. However, since it could mean significant changes to StoreMan code and existing data, I'm reluctant to recommend it. 
 
By all means feel free to comment, or not. There may be time to discuss it on Thursday, otherwise I'll ask Marty to implement (1) or (2)

I'm still a bit unsure what to do about how to handle saving progress 
(in terms of cryovial_store etc), and exiting retrieval assistant. 
 
I printed out all our recent emails to go downstairs and have another 
think about it (like friday's meeting, but with myself) and am still not 
sure I agree or understand the procedure for 'sign off', whatever that 
means. Then I noticed a subtle difference between two of your recent 
emails: one says there should be seven buttons, and another says there 
should be "roughly six" buttons: 
 
 > We continued the discussion after you left and hope we've come up with 
something that fits the requirements. It has roughly six buttons: Enter, 
Not Found, Skip, Bad, Note and Sign Off. 
 
So I think we're all still unsure what should happen. 
 
To restate my previous/current understanding of what I thought should 
happen: 
 
    general use of retrieval assistant 
         changes in status are recorded to l_cryovial_retrieval and c_box_retrieval, but nothing to cryovial_store 
 
    user reaches end of chunk 
         confirm form asks for their password (see note 3) 
             if ok 
                 all new non-expected and non-deferred vials are saved in cryovial_store 
                 if this completes the chunk, mark it complete visually and move to next chunk (see note 1) 
                 if this completes the job 
                     mark deferred vials as NOT_FOUND (note 4) 
                     mark the job/task complete in whichever table is appropriate 
 
    user exits 
         confirm form asks for their password 
         if ok 
             all new non-expected and non-deferred vials are saved in cryovial_store (see note 2) 
     
    user selects a different chunk 
         previously skipped samples are able to be actioned again 
     
    user goes to storage facility again to continue in-progress retrieval 
         previously skipped samples able to be actioned again (due to having been saved to the database in l_c_r and c_b_r) 
 
 
note 1. don't save it as being saved anywhere, its status is implied (possibly for performance reasons i.e. not needing to join a 
`c_retrieval_chunk` table in the big query) 
note 2. i.e. if there are any that have not already been saved because the end of the current chunk has not been reached 
note 3. the form that asks for their password I will call "the confirm form" to avoid confusion and does not necessarily mean the job is 
finished, though it seems as what they are doing at that point is "signing off" what they have done at that point (finishing a chunk, 
exiting and going back to base), which I assumed would be necessary for audit trail purposes etc. 
note 4. the only point at which vials are marked NOT_FOUND is when the job is finished. 
 
Let me know what you think.

Hi Chris 
 
It's worth discussing on Thursday. All I can add for now is: 
 
1) The "roughly six" e-mail was after our first meeting whereas the "seven buttons" followed the second 
 
2) Movement jobs go through stages: 
 - when the job is created, the current box_store record is marked "move expected" and a new one added "slot reserved" 
 - there's no equivalent of found or deferred since the boxes don't have to be moved in a pre-specified order 
 - when a section has been completed, the user clicks Done; "move expected" becomes "removed" and "slot reserved" becomes "slot allocated" 
 - when everything's been done, the user clicks Sign Off; they see the confirmation screen, then "slot allocated" become "slot confirmed" 
 
I hope that helps

Two-state solution?

## stuff for today 2104-07-30

(from nick's big list)

### Referred

Check it looks at `c_slot_allocation` as well as `l_box_arrival`
**Always** need boxset/retrieval number if history's going to be linked to it

### Assistant

Check disposal jobs tidied up, saved # ?
Check created jobs picked, analysed  # ?

### for discussion tomorrow

`C_RETRIEVAL_JOB.box_set`    The retrieval number, used as a barcode prefix for boxes in this job

show box set in retrieval list and manage lists, filter by box set e.g. like in view lists
filter by exercise?
could use GROUP BY SQL?
exercise
  box set
    retrieval task?

## tree view?

box set 
   retrieval task

TfrmRetrievalJobList::loadJobs()
    LCDbCryoJobs::records().read(LIMSDatabase::getCentralDb(), LCDbCryoJob::UNKNOWN, true)
    job->getBoxSet();

email from me@home:

>treeview - forget sets and maps etc for now, just fill with Exercise n, box set x, and a real job, to show the structure. Put a 'New Job' button that adds a new exercise, box set and job, or box set and job to an existing exercise, and a 'Modify/Add to exercise" (or to box set?) to add a job to a box set.

### 3-hour meeting, 11am Thurs 2014-07-31

>3-hour meeting going back over last week's 6-hour mega-meeting, and coming back to much the same idea that I predicted we would settle on about an hour into the first meeting, but with some extra ideas and now we all seem to agree at least. #lifeofasoftwaredeveloper

#### not found

"Not Found" means NOT_FOUND, skip and pick up in another job.

#### Wrong vial screen

    # Main screen: Enter, Not Found, Skip
    Not found:
        Mark NOT_FOUND; Next row
    Skip:
        Mark DEFERRED; Next row
    Enter/accept:
        barcode1 = expected
        Right barcode (entered == expected):
            Mark COLLECTED; Next row
        Wrong barcode (entered != expected):
            show Wrong barcode screen
            hide Replace button
            while:
                Enter:
                    barcode2 = entered
                    entered == expected:    
                        # Now correct 
                        Close, Mark COLLECTED; Next row
                    barcode2 == barcode1:   
                        # Wrong and same
                        Display Replace button
                        continue
                    barcode2 != expected && barcode2 != barcode1: 
                        # Wrong and different                        
                        barcode1 = barcode2
                        continue
                Replace: # may not be visible
                    Save new cryo record
                    Mark lcr COLLECTED or WRONG(?); Next row
                Skip:
                    Mark DEFFERED, Next row

#### Save, not Exit

Traditional way is to prevent exit unless save pressed.

### does the plan screen read NOT_FOUND `cryovial_store` records?

e.g. if they were not found in a previous retrieval? 
Yes, it reads `cryovial_store` of any status, which also includes vials marked `IGNORED`, e.g. secondaries not needed in a previous job.

putting my finger on it? making it up as you go along and being confident of it - implies something
