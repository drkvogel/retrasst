Retrieval assistant is largely complete: retrieval plans can be created and followed and this is recorded in l_cryovial_retrieval. Other tables need to be updated.

If the user exits without finishing the job, once they've signed off: 

 * C_box_retrieval: set time_stamp, status = 1 
 * Cryovial_store: 
	* Primary, source: if found update removed, status = 5, otherwise status = 7 
	* Primary, destination: if found update time_stamp, status = 1, otherwise status = 99 
	* Secondary, source: if primary found clear retrieval_cid, status = 1, otherwise if secondary found update removed, status = 5, otherwise set status = 7 
	* Secondary, destination: if primary found set status = 99, otherwise if secondary found update time_stamp, status = 1, otherwise status = 99 
 * Box_name (if record found): update time_stamp, box_capacity, status = 1 
 * C_box_name (if record found): update time_stamp, box_capacity, status = 1 

At the end of a job, once they've signed off: 

 * C_box_retrieval: set time_stamp, status = 2 
 * Cryovial_store: as above 
 * Box_name (if record found): update time_stamp, box_capacity, status = 2 
 * C_box_name (if record found): update time_stamp, box_capacity, status = 2 
 * C_retrieval_job: update finish_date, status = 2 
 
## My notes

 * "source" and "destination" (boxes) > "old"/"new" or "current"/"future"
 * "Defer" would be a better name than "Skip" for passing over a sample
 * c_box_name is copied from box_name by a cron job
    * do I now use c_box_name in one of my queries? yes, because it speeds things up
    * in which case, box changes should be made to both c_box_name, and box_name (if a box_name record is present - not always the case). The cron job should be able to cope with this (up to date c_box_name entries already existing)
    * setting the timestamps correctly (to 'now') is crucial 
 * accept button should be next to text box
 * reported chunk sizes look wrong (not 200)
 * changes to l_cryovial_retrieval should be saved on the fly
 * changes to c_box_retrieval, cryovial_store should be done on signoff and exit
 * there should be 4 cryovial_store records for each requested sample: source and destination for primary and secondary aliquots
    * NOT_FOUND will be a new status
    * currently ALLOCATED, CONFIRMED, MOVE_EXPECTED, DESTROYED, ANALYSED, TRANSFERRED, DELETED = 99
    * no IGNORED status?
    * if primary aliquot is found:
        - set primary src TRANSFERRED?
        - set primary dest CONFIRMED?
        - set secondary src CONFIRMED?
        - set secondary dest DELETED?
        - set l_cryo 
    * if secondary aliquot is found:
        - set primary src NOT_FOUND?
        - set primary dest DELETED?
        - set secondary src TRANSFERRED?
        - set secondary dest CONFIRMED?
    * should probably do a truth table of primary/secondary src/dest cryovial_store/l_cryovial_retrieval
    * make sure both aliquots are dealt with whatever happens
