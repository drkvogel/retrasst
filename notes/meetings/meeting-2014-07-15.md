## meeting 2014-07-15

NG, MR, CB

Late - oops! Thought we were done with meetings for now...

Looked at Rationalise, View Lists, Create Lists, (Retrieval Assistant), Discard Samples

### new table

New table to be created to complement c_retrieval_job to track what happens to boxes after they have been retrieved - may be analysed (Analyse Samples), or disposed, but in chunks or even part of chunks. Hence need finer-grained way of tracking what happens to jobs after they have been retrieved.


### new screen

Discussed using code for Retrieval Assistant main screen for new screen ('Manage Jobs?'):

* copy-paste from RetrAsstMain
* subclass one from the other
* make existing abstract and subclass both

### discard

3 stages: 

* Select samples
* Confirm removal
* Confirm disposal

Middle stage (Confirm removal) possibly/probably duplicates what Retrieval Assistant is/should be doing and should be removed. Confirm disposal is intended to be a double-check that boxes collected for disposal in retrieval assistant are really to be disposed, probably by a different person and not at the cryo store.

* Confirm this - and is there any code I can use from it?
* Anything in Confirm disposal
