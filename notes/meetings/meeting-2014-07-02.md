MR, NG, CB

* refresh job list after save plan

* what I call 'pos' for vessel should be 'loc'/location in site, pos, vessel
* some location info not required (in brackets: site, loc, vessel, [shelf,] [pos,] structure, slot
* sometimes current storage info will not be available (box has not been through box reception and storage sync, hence status will be CONFIRMED [2] rather than IN_TANK [4]), but box name and tube pos will be
* idea of 'secondary' may be spurious, refer to 'backup' instead
* prefer 'retrieve' to 'collect'
* lose box type in collect screen (it was required for plan screen though?)
* prefer 'pos 1 in box 1' to 'box 1 [1]'
* lose percentage in chunk progress
* chunk progress should show position in list as well as items dealt with (in a separate column?) 
    * get thesaurus out: "completed", "dealt with"
* reorganise info at bottom of retrieve screen: 3 panels: src, barcode, dest; with barcode entry input underneath barcode
* prompts for new src box and new dest box - flash different colours for each? beep? sample?
* bug: don't count combined(/compound?) sample where primary is not found, but backup is not actioned/deferred as 'done' (ie. shouldn't count in chunk progress, but does) 
* finish chunk embarrasment - 'handle close'?? fencepost bug?
* narrower sorters - almost went off screen.
    - prefer 'asc' to 'ascending' and reduce width of widgets

also there was an ingres error at one point:

    XDB error: IIAPI_ST_ERRORInfo: ERROR '22008' 4304: 21 is not a valid month for a date/time column.
