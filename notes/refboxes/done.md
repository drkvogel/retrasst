## records too dark grey-

`SLOT_CONFIRMED` records (`vlab::test_ldbc`, THRIVE and Kadoorie) too dark grey - because not a status I expected. Actually these are valid cases, which occur when storage sync encounters boxes with negative ids, and refers them [check]

clLtGray looks the same as clSilver

## kadoorie boxes have no `c_box_name` records-

Thus, can only be discarded. The data needs to be imported from the Kadoorie project database, which is a bit of a political wrangle, but should happen, so not something my program has to worry about.
