I've been talking to Martin about conventions for retrieval tasks. This is what we've come up with so far: 
 
 * retrieval_cid: unique ID from c_id_sequence, used in box_store and cryovial_store to show that a box or cryovial will be/has been moved as part of this job 
 
 * exercise_cid: if a retrieval can be divided up into distinct tasks, the whole exercise is given a name and description in c_object_name and the individual tasks are linked to it 
 
 * external_name: usually generated by StoreMan but can be modified by the user. Possible naming convention: <project> <job type> <box set>, e.g. SEARCH Disposal 42 
 
 * description: entered by the user when the task is set up and displayed for each job. Tim and Martin are agreeing a suitable naming convention 
 
 * project_cid: the project database to look at (can be zero if there's more than one project involved, e.g. when moving boxes) 
 
 * box_set: a small, positive number, used to group boxes for a particular task (or exercise?) This can be used as short hand for a retrieval, e.g. "Retrieval #52', and is included in the box barcodes, e.g. '52-001234' 
 
 * reason: a short description of what the boxes will be used for. Box names will include the project, reason and barcode, e.g. "HPS2-THRIVE Lp(s)_retrieval 52-001234' 
 
 * job_type: what needs to be done, e.g. move boxes or rationalise samples. Different parts of StoreMan create/use different types 
 
 * reason_flags (tbc): bit flags to indicate outcome, e.g. analysed y/n, original disposed of y/n, sent away y/n - Martin to confirm details 
 
 * start_date: when the work started (if it has) 
 
 * claimed_until: set by StoreMan while a task is being carried out to prevent another instance from accessing it at the same time 
 
 * finish_date: empty until the task has been completed 
 
Can you review your code at some point to see if it might be a problem? Hopefully my description and your code can converge before we release StoreMan
