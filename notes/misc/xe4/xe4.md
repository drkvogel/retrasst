## official installer

Installed from <\\sanback\Software Installers\RAD Studio\radstudio_xe4_esd>, copied to <C:\Users\cbird\Downloads\radstudio_xe4_esd> via my phone SD card.

Used my serial from <licence for this on sharepoint.txt>: `MNAG-N3A8UF-N6W4BD-32PS`. 

Registered with remembered-from-ages-ago username `ctsu_oxford` and password `ctsu_oxford`, seemed to work without a hitch.

Needed to add `C:\Program Files (x86)\Ingres\IngresII\ingres\files` to Project Include path for `iiapi.h`, but this is the 32-bit Ingres and the project (Storeman) is now 64-bit, so although it all builds somehow, link fails with 

>[ilink64 Error] Fatal: Unable to open file 'IIAPI_W64.A'

The 64-bit `iiapi.h` should be picked up from `C:\Program Files\Actian\IngresIJ\ingres\files\`, which doesn't exist as I haven't installed 64-bit Ingres on my laptop, instructions on how to do so are in an email from Geraint at work that I haven't yet forwarded to myself, but I can at least build projects which is enough for now.
