## debugger crash

>"Embarcadero Debugger Kernel has stopped working" 

A bug - still open, and no workaround:

<http://qc.embarcadero.com/wc/qcmain.aspx/qcmain.aspx?d=115928>

Builder can't create .exe after

A debug process crashed but is still running and trying to attach to it - find extra `bds.exe` processes and kill them.
