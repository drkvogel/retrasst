sort "aliquot aliquot ascending" is sorting by ID, so primary (-31781) comes after secondary (-31782)
 shouldn't show aliquot anyway

up/down arrows to show column sort

Source/Current box - standardise name - current probably better?
    
From meeting:

Part 1
 * Only display primary aliquots.  
 * Don’t allow people to save a plan with chunks of more than 1001 samples for sample retrieval/disposal/reorganisation

Part 2
 * Chunk list should include a second row for each chunk if there is a secondary aliquot (second part of each chunk?)
 * Only read the currently selected chunk/aliquot from the database when it is selected
 * Allow user to fill gaps in boxes from secondary aliquot after primary aliquot (partly?) completed
 * Empty source boxes (all cryovials "accepted" or "not found") will normally be discarded.  Final stage should ask user to confirm that vessel/structure/slot is now empty, otherwise box should be referred.  All source boxes from a reorganisation task should end up empty

---

 * Usual sort order before chunking: destination box and position
 * Usual sort order for each chunk: vessel position, shelf, structure, slot and current position

## Done
add 1 chunk - must add to last current chunk, not in middle
factor out select_stats into Util-
click on chunk doesn't work now - stays on current chunk-
auto-select last chunk-
 * Show aliquot type(s) but not as a separate column
 * Chunk list should show destination boxes rather than source-
 * Columns (left to right): cryovial barcode, site, vessel position, vessel name, shelf (if necessary), structure name, slot, current box, current position, destination box, destination position
 * Columns (left to right): cryovial barcode, site, vessel position, vessel name, shelf (if necessary), structure name, slot, current box, current position, destination box, destination position
