drawcell border round selected chunk
can only double click to split chunk on last chunk?

sorting works again! OMG!
sorting by shelf doesn't seem to do anything
it is quite slow though...

### Cultural learnings of 2013-09-28

 * Templated code is not compiled until it is instantiated - i.e. if there is part of your template that is not used, it will not throw a compile error even if bad syntax
 * Debug symbols do not seem to be generated for templated code, meaning breakpoints cannot be set. I don't know if this can be changed in the options.
 * Windows' API debug function is `OutputDebugString()` and is captured by the Event Log tab in C++ Builder
 * Use it like this: `OutputDebugString(L"string")` or like this: `wstringstream oss; oss<<__FUNC__<<"text"<<var; OutputDebugString(oss.str().c_str());`
 * Churchill canteen food is OK and cheap, good for recovering.
 * Andrew Weatherall's Vice Mix is quite good.

 * Chunks: 
    * what is a chunk? it's a bit of the whole list. If The Whole List is an object, we shouldn't duplicate it in any way. either:
        * move all the contents of the initial list into chunks, or 
        * keep the list, but chunks context indexes into it, and do partial_sorts of its contents.
            * then again, the StringGridWrapper should be shy - just display and sort sth, without knowing whether that list is a part or a whole
 * StringGridWrapper
    * Have implemented the StringGridWrapper, but sorting is no longer working. Must rembember that at all times, even if the chunk is a default chunk containing all rows, we should be sorting a chunk and not the underlying vector of rows.
    * That means the 'rows' of the StringGridWrapper should be set to be the rows of whichever chunk is currently selected?
    * At which point (which routine) should we do this? Something smells wrong about the current way chunks are handled.
    * Pragmatic - forget sorting for now, fire some tracer bullets - get some visual stuff up and database inserts going


 * Emails from Nick/Martin
    * Another minor feature to add to the retrieval assistant when you’re implementing the final part: when you’ve finished retrieving samples from a box, check if it’s empty.  That’s unlikely to be necessary for tasks I’ve created but anyone using Jonathan’s utility to rationalise tanks may end up throwing the old boxes away
    This means we’ll be demonstrating next week using the mirror system, just in case it makes any difference Nick (I'm happy for it to be split I f that makes more sense. Martin)
    * As I mentioned earlier, there's a bit of a problem including boxes in a retrieval if we don't know where they are.  Our current thinking is that we'll ask the user about such boxes when they create a retrieval list and add dummy/incomplete box_store records.  I'm about to add such records for existing jobs.  Please ignore any integrity errors that result
    * This doesn't seem to have caused any problems.  The dummy box_store records have a status of 1 (unconfirmed), rack_cid=0 and slot_position=0.  StoreDAO::findBox() will still return false because it looks for the rack_cid in c_rack_number
 * HR
    * worried about ay?
        * talk to ana about it - moving house, being tired
        * talk to occ health about that
        * talk to union
        * get nick to verify that ref boxes was ready ages ago and generic comms is in use
        * get rg to verify that stig is working and in use
        * tell all concerned that it is only because I am worried that ay is looking for ways to discredit me that I am doing this.
        * I hate my boss. Can I move?

# Done

click on chunk - show wait cursor while loading-
sample grid - shelf and vessel wrong way round-dn
in fact, storage details should come after src box - not done, was going to get my coldefs and sorters working first and re-arrange columns like that.-done
copyLocation
    position vs rack_pos vs tank_pos?
        src_box_pos is dupe of store_record->getPosition()
"An empty retrieval list" - null chunk!
what is paul doing with lua?
double-clicking a sample/box should mark the end of a chunk and create a new one
i started the coldef thing because I put the aliquot column in and it threw all the sorters out

---
sorters are not on correct columns; ColDef class is supposed to prevent this
'sorting' a column where values are largely the same (e.g. dest box "Example retrieval box 9") results in almost random sorting
things are 
            
# Sorting out the Sorter

   Test(std::vector<T *> & v) : vec(v) {}   
   std::vector<SampleRow *>    vials;   
   Test<SampleRow *> test(vials);
E2285 Could not find a match for 'Test<SampleRow *>::Test(vector<SampleRow *,allocator<SampleRow *> >)'
use typedef? use pointer to vector instead of reference
now just passing function pointer to ColDef constructor is not right:
E2034 Cannot convert 'bool(const SampleRow *,const SampleRow *)' to 'bool (*)(SampleRow * const *,SampleRow * const *)'
notice ** double pointers - ah, because Sorter was specialized with SampleRow, and ColDef is being specialized with SampleRow *    
---
    
# Problems

 * asc and desc funcs both need to be declared - couldn't one be a reverse of the other?
   * already removed from class spec - implementations in SampleRow now redundant-taken out
 * why are the sort funcs implemented in SampleRow anyway?
 * using enum as parameter to Sorter::sort rather than calling sort_asc/desc/toggle directly seems unnecessary
 * separate Sorter array means it can get out of sync with column definitions - group together in (e.g.) ColDef?
   * does Sorter being a template make this a problem? the type T is e.g. SampleRow for all columns

### throwing errors

### not throwing errors?

must be thread-related? e.g. sample->store_record->getBoxID()?
non-threaded version seems ok... something in worker thread must be doing something gui-related... one of the classes descended from a VCL class?
void __fastcall LCDbCryoJobs::Renewal(TObject *)? timer in main thread though so should be ok
what if I take the synchronized updateStatus calls out?
  looked promising, but still crashing
be pragmatic, it seems to work non-threaded.
still much faster when locations are found, shouldn't be - is the query messing things up?
no, still crashes on notAThread
    on second load of same job <-- code smell
    vials not being reset/deleted?
    some other change I've made recently - follow it through from the start   
    unitialized map? clear?
    it was because the map was static <---------!!!
