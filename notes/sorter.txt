click on chunk - show wait cursor while loading
drawcell border round selected chunk
can only double click to split chunk on last chunk?

sorting works again! OMG!
sorting by shelf doesn't seem to do anything
it is quite slow though...

### Cultural learnings of 2013-09-28

 * Templated code is not compiled until it is instantiated - i.e. if there is part of your template that is not used, it will not throw a compile error even if bad syntax
 * Debug symbols do not seem to be generated for templated code, meaning breakpoints cannot be set. I don't know if this can be changed in the options.
 * Windows' API debug function is `OutputDebugString()` and is captured by the Event Log tab in C++ Builder
 * Use it like this: `OutputDebugString(L"string")` or like this: `wstringstream oss; oss<<__FUNC__<<"text"<<var; OutputDebugString(oss.str().c_str());`
 * Churchill canteen food is OK and cheap, good for recovering.
 * Andrew Weatherall's Vice Mix is quite good.

Chunk: what is a chunk? it's a bit of the whole list. If The Whole List is an object, we shouldn't duplicate it in any way - either 
	move all the contents of the initial list into chunks, 
or 
	keep the list, but chunks context indexes into it, and do partial_sorts of its contents.
	then again, the StringGridWrapper should be shy - just display and sort sth, without knowing whether that list is a part or a whole

Have implemented the StringGridWrapper, but sorting is no longer working. Must rembember that at all times, even if the chunk is a default chunk containing all rows, we should be sorting a chunk and not the underlying vector of rows.

That means the 'rows' of the StringGridWrapper should be set to be the rows of whichever chunk is currently selected.
At which point (which routine) should we do this? Something smells wrong about the current way chunks are handled.
Pragmatic - forget sorting for now, fire some tracer bullets - get some visual stuff up and database inserts going

I have your new card so please pop in with the old one when you’re next passing.

Another minor feature to add to the retrieval assistant when you’re implementing the final part: when you’ve finished retrieving samples from a box, check if it’s empty.  That’s unlikely to be necessary for tasks I’ve created but anyone using Jonathan’s utility to rationalise tanks may end up throwing the old boxes away

Chris - This means we’ll be demonstrating next week using the mirror system, just in case it makes any difference Nick

I'm happy for it to be split I f that makes more sense. Martin

Hi Martin Did I gather that the labs are going to be quiet on 2nd as well as 1st October?  If it's going to be our only chance for a while, can we clobber Ingres both days?  Rather than doing the whole thing in one day, I'd like to suggest rebuilding the test system (v2.7.2) on 1st October and, if that goes according to plan, do the development system (v2.7.3) the following day.

As I mentioned earlier, there's a bit of a problem including boxes in a retrieval if we don't know where they are.  Our current thinking is that we'll ask the user about such boxes when they create a retrieval list and add dummy/incomplete box_store records.  I'm about to add such records for existing jobs.  Please ignore any integrity errors that result

This doesn't seem to have caused any problems.  The dummy box_store records have a status of 1 (unconfirmed), rack_cid=0 and slot_position=0.  StoreDAO::findBox() will still return false because it looks for the rack_cid in c_rack_number

worried about ay?
  talk to ana about it - moving house, being tired
  talk to occ health about that
  talk to union
  get nick to verify that ref boxes was ready ages ago and generic comms is in use
  get rg to verify that stig is working and in use
  tell all concerned that it is only because I am worried that ay is looking for ways to discredit me that I am doing this.
I hate my boss. Can I move?

sample grid - shelf and vessel wrong way round-dn
in fact, storage details should come after src box - not done, was going to get my coldefs and sorters working first and re-arrange columns like that.
                                            
copyLocation
    position vs rack_pos vs tank_pos?
        src_box_pos is dupe of store_record->getPosition()

"An empty retrieval list" - null chunk!
        
what is paul doing with lua?

double-clicking a sample/box should mark the end of a chunk and create a new one

i started the coldef thing because I put the aliquot column in and it threw all the sorters out

---
sorters are not on correct columns; ColDef class is supposed to prevent this
'sorting' a column where values are largely the same (e.g. dest box "Example retrieval box 9") results in almost random sorting
things are 
            
# Sorting out the Sorter

   Test(std::vector<T *> & v) : vec(v) {}
   
   std::vector<SampleRow *>    vials;
   
   Test<SampleRow *> test(vials);

E2285 Could not find a match for 'Test<SampleRow *>::Test(vector<SampleRow *,allocator<SampleRow *> >)'

use typedef?
use pointer to vector instead of reference

now just passing function pointer to ColDef constructor is not right

E2034 Cannot convert 'bool(const SampleRow *,const SampleRow *)' to 'bool (*)(SampleRow * const *,SampleRow * const *)'
    notice ** double pointers
  
  - how did I do it with Sorter?

ah, because Sorter was specialized with SampleRow, and ColDef is being specialized with SampleRow *

# Problems

 * asc and desc funcs both need to be declared - couldn't one be a reverse of the other?
   * already removed from class spec - implementations in SampleRow now redundant-taken out
 * why are the sort funcs implemented in SampleRow anyway?
 * using enum as parameter to Sorter::sort rather than calling sort_asc/desc/toggle directly seems unnecessary
 * separate Sorter array means it can get out of sync with column definitions - group together in (e.g.) ColDef?
   * does Sorter being a template make this a problem? the type T is e.g. SampleRow for all columns
   *

must be thread-related? e.g. sample->store_record->getBoxID()?
non-threaded version seems ok... something in worker thread must be doing something gui-related... one of the classes descended from a VCL class?
void __fastcall LCDbCryoJobs::Renewal(TObject *)? timer in main thread though so should be ok
what if I take the synchronized updateStatus calls out?
  looked promising, but still crashing
be pragmatic, it seems to work non-threaded.
still much faster when locations are found, shouldn't be - is the query messing things up?
no, still crashes on notAThread
    on second load of same job <-- code smell
    vials not being reset/deleted?
    some other change I've made recently - follow it through from the start   
    unitialized map? clear?
    it was because the map was static
