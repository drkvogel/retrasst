fix comboSorter - broken window
 doesn't have descending option

what are we listing?
  sample retrieval
     samples
are we finding the destination boxes correctly?

storage (site, pos, shelf, vessel, structure, slot) of which box? current or destination? both?
    does it matter for setting up the chunks, or which matters more?
    
    in the retrieval, will want to find storage of both?

are there any example jobs that have the destination boxes
what about secondary aliquots?
