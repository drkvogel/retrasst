sgvialsfixedclick debuglog: show sorter name
    sortChunk(currentChunk(), ACol, Sorter<SampleRow *>::TOGGLE);
curr pos sorting doing something funny, dest pos sorting not doing anything
    because adding 'aliquot' column skewed everything - as there is no combined column definition (ColDef?) class,
     sorter funcs can get out of sync with column names
    does it need an enum at all? if an array of objects was initialized, numcols would be the size of the array

storage (site, pos, shelf, vessel, structure, slot) of which box? current or destination? both?
    does it matter for setting up the chunks, or which matters more?
    
    in the retrieval, will want to find storage of both?

are there any example jobs that have the destination boxes
what about secondary aliquots?
