Hi Chris

Glad most of the move's gone OK.  As for the meeting, I guess the question is do you need Martin's feedback yet or do you still have more to do.  If the latter, I could suggest another postponement

Thanks -

I got quite a bit of stuff moved with the help of a friend - my car chose just recently to knacker itself so is still in the garage - but need to do one last push. The letting agent has offered the use of his van so I can get out of there quick - could I take tomorrow off please to finish moving?

Nick and I have a meeting scheduled tomorrow at 12pm - I wonder if we could postpone it or I could pop in just for that? Will talk to Nick when he is in.

Chris
