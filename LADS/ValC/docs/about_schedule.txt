schedule is a fossil file (www.fossil-scm.org).

It maintains a 'to do' list, for tracking tasks and progress.

To view:

1) Install Fossil
2) cd to the directory containing the file called 'schedule'.
3) Type 'fossil ui schedule'. You should find yourself looking at a web page with the title 'ValC Schedule'.
5) Click on 'Tickets' and then 'All Tickets' in order to obtain the current task list.

Tickets have a 'who' - the person responsible. One of 'Developer', 'Tech Lead', 'Project Mgr'. In reality, one person might be wearing these 3 different hats, but it serves as a means of describing the type of task. 

'Developer' stuff is reasonably well-specified functionality/bugs to be worked on.
'Tech Lead' is for stuff that needs requirements analysis.
'Project Mgr' is for tasks relating to the progress of the project, risk management.


These distinct roles operate at different levels of abstraction, but are inter-dependent.  The Project Mgr is pre-occupied with the scope of the project. Within that scope, the Tech Lead is responsible for carving up the work and ensuring that it is do-able. The Developer is responsible for doing it.
