# config-gui.txt provides assorted parameters for the ValC GUI
#
# This helps to 
# (1) standardise styles in a programmatic way across the application,
# which means that application-wide parameters can be changed with a single edit,
# rather than change a whole bunch of styles that use that parameter.
# (2) provide parameters for things that don't appear in styles
